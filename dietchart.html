    <h1>3.Ketogenic Diet</h1>
    <hr><br>
    <p>Ketogenic diet is high fat and a low carb diet which is very useful and offers many benefits to the health. It helps people lose weight and also improves health. Ketogenic diet help fight against diabetes, cancer, and Alzheimer disease.

        This type of diet has been in existence for a number of years and was first introduced in 1924. Initially the diet was known to effectively treat epilepsy. But as alternative medication became more effective, the diet has since been known to help reduce weight and increase body performance.
        
        This kind of diet is similar to the Atkins diet as well as the low carb high fat diet, but the main difference lies in the fact that while protein restrictions are practiced in case of the Keto diet, protein intake is allowed in case of the other two types.
        
        This type of diet helps in Ketosis. Thus, as an individual adapts to the ketogenic diet, his body tends to reach the required ketone level (tiny fuel molecules produced in the body), which will then help lose weight and improve physical as well as mental health.
        
        Ketones are known to be alternative forms of fuel, which are used by the body when the levels of blood sugar are less. Produced in the liver, these molecules are made from fat. Thus, the body starts using fat to run, resulting in excess fat loss and the consequent weight loss as well.
        
        Mention Different Types of Ketogenic Diets?
        Following are the various types of keto diet:
        
        Standard keto diet (SKD): This diet includes food like butter, ghee, avocado fatty fish, meat, olives or olive oil. Diet must include 150 gms of fat per day so as to increase the metabolism. This also means that one must stick to the green-leafy vegetables, non-starchy vegetables and fruits with low carbohydrates, protein should also be eaten moderately that is about 90 gms a day.
        Targeted keto diet (TKD): This diet is popular among athletes and sportsperson. But is changes a bit and includes additional 20-30 grams of carbohydrates before and after a workout. It provides higher intensity during exercise and enhanced recovery. The diet includes fruits grain-based food or sports nutrition food.
        Cyclical keto diet (CKD): This diet is cyclical and it is eaten for 5 days a week and 2 days normal diet. If you want the best result in this then eat carbohydrate-rich food on your off days which include dairy products, starchy veggies, fruits, and whole grains. If you don't want to take off every week then you can save it for your special occasions like birthdays or wedding
        High-protein keto diet: This plan involves high protein diet for about 120 grams per day and eating fat for about 130 grams per day. But carbohydrates are restricted and only be taken 10% or less. High-protein keto diets are most helpful in losing weight.
        Who needs a Ketogenic diet?
        A person who wants to lose weight in a healthy way and want to remain fit can start ketogenic diet.
        
        Who is not eligible for the treatment?

But before starting the diet, one has to ensure that he is not on any diabetes medication and is taking in low doses of insulin. The diet is great for those with blood pressure issues too, but one should consult the doctor before starting the diet. The diet should be avoided during the period of breastfeeding.

        <h1> 4. Low Carb Diet</h1>
        <hr><br>
   
        <p>Carbohydrates are one of the nutrients found in all foods that come from plants. Chemically, they are classified into monosaccharide, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. Simply, they can be classified into simple carbs and complex carbs.

    We have to know that if we want to follow the low carb diet, we have to avoid simple carbs derived from corn syrups, sugars, cane sugars, and honey. Complex carbs are supposed to be healthy according to low carb diet and are allowed while following the diet.
    
    Foods to be Included in Your Low Carb Diet
    Foods to include in a Low Carb Diet
    Foods to include in a Low Carb Diet
    Soaked Almonds, nuts and seeds like roasted soybean, roasted Bengal gram dal, roasted flax seeds, roasted sunflower seeds, rajma or kidney beans, mung daal, paneer or cottage cheese, dahi or yogurt, red chanaa, sprouts, milk, soybean, egg white, chicken and fish are the main foods that should be included in your low carb diet.
    
    You should also include sweet potato, quinoa, beans, lentils, peas, brown rice, wild rice, potato, corn on the cob, rolled oatmeal, whole grain pasta, couscous, multi-grain bread, whole wheat pita bread, , whole-grain bagel,
    
    whole-wheat tortilla, kale, spinach, broccoli, peppers (sweet), carrots, cauliflower, cabbage, winter squash, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, watermelon, orange, mango, peaches, pineapple and figs.
    
    5 Great Tips for Following the Low Carb Diet
    1. Include Complex Carbs in Your Diet
    Following the low-carbohydrate diet entails avoiding simple carbs and including complex carbs in your meals. Include whole grains like brown rice, oats, whole wheat, barley, whole wheat pasta and whole wheat bread on your plate. These are complex carbs that will enhance your weight loss process [1].
    
    2. Increase Your Protein Intake
    Consumption of proteins in your low carb diet helps you in attaining satisfaction. They also stabilize the blood sugar levels and control your food cravings. You can include low-fat dairy products like milk, yogurt and cottage cheese in your low carb diet. Also eat leans meats, beans and legumes [2].
    
    3. Make Fiber a Large Part of Your Low Carb Diet
    Have at least 2-3 portions of raw salads and fruits every day. This will ensure that you are consuming the required amount of fiber in your diet.
    
    Also, green leafy vegetables should be included on the list. They are power packs of minerals and help in the control of blood pressure and blood sugar levels [3]. Since they are high in fiber, they also play a role in weight loss. Besides these, you could also add flax seeds, fenugreek or methi seeds, sprouts and whole grains to your meals.
    
    4. Steer Clear of Fats
    When you are following the low carb diet, you have to avoid all kinds of food with Trans fats. This includes fries, pakodas, chips and other deep-fried foods [4].
    
    Try including monosaturated fats like olive oil, peanut oil, and mustard seed oil since they limit your carb intake by giving you a feeling of dietary satisfaction.
    
    5. Do Regular Exercises
    It is a known fact that any diet will prove effective only if you supplement it with regular exercise.
    
    Regular exercise helps in maintaining a healthy weight along with maintaining the sugar level of your body. It also gives you energy and agility, which keeps you active, which in turn, decreases your body weight even more.

    <h1>5.Paleo Diet</h1>
    <hr><br>
    <p>What is Paleo Diet?
        Founded by Dr Loren Cordaine, Paleo diet takes things back to the basics. It has been suggested that this diet, in particular, is possibly the best way to lose weight naturally!
        
        The idea behind the Paleo diet is that humans are genetically tuned to eat certain kinds of foods – foods we thrived on as hunters/gatherers. Back then, the food we ate was not laced with growth hormones, antibiotics, and pesticides.
        
        Hence the hunter/gatherers feasted on a rich diet of meat and fish, fruits and veggies, nuts among others. These were among the paleo diet food list.
        
        Paleo diet benefits
        Your diet will be devoid of processed foods and preservatives.
        This diet includes more proteins and fats that will make you less hungry.
        This diet includes lots of vegetables and fruits.
        It focuses on omega 3 fatty acids which make the diet anti-inflammatory.
        It depends heavily on animal flesh, hence, brings more muscle and less fat.
        Paleo diet weight loss
        Paleo diet for weight loss
        What do you eat on the paleo diet?
        Basic Ingredients found in Paleo diet recipes are animals and animal products (like eggs or honey), Fish and seafood, Vegetables and fruits, Raw nuts and seeds, Fats like coconut oil, avocado, and olive.
        
        Paleo Diet meal plan
        The paleo diet meal plan includes meat and fish for protein
        1. Include meats such as beef, lamb, chicken, turkey, pork etc.
        
        2. Go for seafood like salmon, shrimp, shellfish etc.
        
        3. Omega- 3 enriched eggs are advised for the paleo diet.
        
        4. Broccoli, kale, onions, tomatoes, carrots are the vegetables that rule the paleo diet.
        
        Foods that are not on the Paleo Diet Food List 
        Cereals or grains.
        Legumes or pulses.
        Dairy and dairy products.
        Refined oils (like canola, palm oil, and soybean oil).
        Processed foods.
        The Modern Day Diets vs the Paleo Diet Plan
        Our Paleolithic ancestors mostly consumed fruits, vegetables, nuts, roots, fish and wild animals.
        
        Their diet comprised of a wide variety in contrast to our modern day diets. This was their paleo diet plans as compared to ours today. 
        
        Today, our dietary choices consist mainly of foods high in refined sugars, high fructose corn syrup, cereal and cereal based products, and dairy and dairy products.
        
        According to the theory of ‘paleo diet’, the agricultural revolution and animal domestication displaced the original food habits.
        
        Thus, obesity, diabetes, heart diseases, hypertension (high blood pressure), skin problems, allergies, and cancer are categorized as the “diseases of cultivation”.
        
        While individuals following the typical modern day diet are suffering from these health issues, it has been said that our Paleolithic ancestors did not have any such chronic diseases or degenerative conditions.
        
        Hence the Caveman’s diet food list in modern day diets does have benefits. 
        
        Paleo diet plan for weight loss
        Simply by restricting the processed foods itself, this paleo diet plan brings a positive change in weight. Moreover, it includes a healthy animal protein that helps in gaining more muscles than fat that increases body metabolism.
        
        This, in turn, helps in weight loss. And according to the constituents of the paleo diet chart, there is reduced consumption of carbohydrates (sugars), and sodium and increased intake of fiber, phytochemicals, and antioxidants.
        
        This can translate to better heart health, reduced risk of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and cancer.
        
        However, the reasons/evidence for excluding cereals, legumes and dairy are not well justified.
        
        Note: A paleo diet chart excludes grains.Whole grains provide fiber and other important nutrients. Numerous studies show that people who eat the most whole grains have a lower risk of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and colon cancer. Moreover, eating grains will make you feel full for a long time and are instant sources of energy. Grains are competitively economical than other food groups. Therefore, following a paleo diet cannot be said healthy entirely. After all, we should not be excluding an entire food group. Possible Nutritionist Shanmukha Priya says, “Eating in moderation is the key.”
        
        In fact, studies have established that the paleo diet food list ingredients are important to maintain optimum health.[1] Nevertheless, highly processed versions are never recommended or found to be beneficial to health.
